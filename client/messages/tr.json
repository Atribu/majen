Its antique texture lends character to boutique hotels and residences, while honed or polished finishes suit refined interiors. Outdoors, brushed or tumbled slabs complement landscaping, garden paths, and pool decks. The stone’s tonal stability supports continuity between inside and outside, helping designers create cohesive transitions.

Consistent sizing across batches supports predictable waste rates and accurate take-offs.",

Moisture-resistant wrapping and clear labeling aid handling at ports and job sites. Packaging is optimized for container loading to minimize risk and freight costs.",

    "Questions":{
    "q1":"What makes Turkish Travertine unique?",
    "answer1":"Turkey offers high-density material and a wide palette of colors such as Ivory, Silver and Noce. Competitive quarry output supports large-scale projects.",
    "q2":"Where is travertine mostly used?",
    "answer2":"Common uses include flooring, wall cladding, facades, pool surrounds, bathrooms and gardens.",
    "q3":"What are the differences between filled & unfilled?",
    "answer3":"Filled travertine has pores filled with resin/cement for a smooth finish. Unfilled keeps natural cavities for a rustic texture.",
    "q4":"How do I maintain travertine?",
    "answer4":"Seal periodically, use pH-neutral cleaners, and avoid acidic products. Outdoor pavers may require re-sealing based on climate.",
    "q5":"Is travertine from Turkey suitable for commercial projects?",
    "answer5":"Yes. Thanks to density and color range, Turkish travertine performs in hotels, offices and retail spaces when specified with the right finish and thickness.",
    "q6":"How do I choose between tiles, slabs and pavers?",
    "answer6":"Use tiles for interiors and walls, slabs for seamless surfaces or countertops, and pavers for outdoor traffic areas. Share drawings and we’ll suggest the most efficient mix."
