          "q": "Which finishes are best for bathrooms?",
          "a": "Honed and tumbled finishes are the most recommended for bathrooms, as they offer slip comfort and a natural feel. Polished finishes may look luxurious but can be slippery when wet, so they are best reserved for vanity tops or decorative walls."

        {
          "q": "Do travertine tiles need sealing?",
          "a": "Yes. Like most natural stones, travertine tiles are porous and require sealing to prevent stains and moisture absorption. It is essential to seal upon installation and reapply every 12–24 months, depending on traffic and exposure. This simple maintenance step significantly extends their lifespan."

          { "q": "What is brushed travertine?", "a": "Brushed travertine is a natural stone finish created by brushing the surface to produce a light texture. This enhances grip and highlights natural veining, making it ideal for floors, walls, and outdoor areas." },
          { "q": "Where is brushed travertine best used?", "a": "Brushed travertine is used indoors for kitchens, bathrooms, and living areas, and outdoors for terraces, patios, and pathways. Its textured finish improves slip resistance in wet conditions." },
          { "q": "Does brushed travertine need sealing?", "a": "Yes. Like other travertine finishes, brushed travertine should be sealed after installation and resealed every 12–24 months to protect against stains and moisture." },
          { "q": "Is brushed travertine slippery?", "a": "No. Brushed travertine is less slippery than polished stone due to its textured surface, making it suitable for bathrooms, pools, and outdoor settings." }
        ],
        "extra": [
          { "q": "Brushed vs Honed vs Tumbled?", "a": "Honed is smooth matte; brushed adds light texture for more grip; tumbled is the most rustic with rounded edges and the highest grip." },
          { "q": "Does brushing improve slip resistance?", "a": "Yes—brushing increases micro-texture, typically achieving R10–R11 slip classes compared to polished (R9)." },
          { "q": "How often should brushed travertine be sealed?", "a": "Every 12–24 months depending on exposure and traffic. Outdoor areas and showers may need more frequent care." }
