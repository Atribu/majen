The filled structure closes natural pores for easier maintenance and long‑term durability, while the natural face preserves the authentic touch of travertine without additional gloss or brushing. Selected from premium Turkish quarries and processed with precise calibration, Majen delivers tone‑consistent slabs prepared for global export and high‑end architectural installations.",

              "title2":"What Is Filled Brushed Vein Cut Travertine?",
              "intro2":"“Vein Cut” reveals the linear direction of the stone’s natural formation. When filled, the stone’s pores are sealed for strength and smoother maintenance; “Brushed” finishing then enhances surface texture with a gentle matte relief. This combination preserves the beauty of travertine veins while improving traction and tactile appeal. Majen’s controlled brushing process creates consistent texture across large areas, ideal for seamless architectural integration.",

               "TextSection": {
            "header1": "Advantages of the Brushed Finish on Vein Cut Slabs",
            "text1": "Brushing enhances the natural feel of travertine, creating a lightly textured surface that is slip-resistant yet smooth to the touch. Unlike polished finishes, it diffuses light softly, emphasizing the stone’s natural flow without glare. Filled pores maintain structural integrity and easy cleaning, making this finish ideal for both interior and exterior use. Majen’s advanced brushing lines ensure depth consistency and premium surface uniformity on every slab.",
            "header2": "Recommended Applications & Design Pairings",
            "text2": "Use Filled Brushed Vein Cut Travertine Slabs for wall cladding, spa areas, pool decks, terraces, and interior feature walls. The balanced matte texture gives spaces a calm, organic character that complements wood, metal, and glass materials. Pair with polished or honed finishes for visual contrast or with matching tiles for seamless indoor–outdoor transitions. Majen supplies cut-to-size elements to ensure design and pattern continuity across all surfaces.",

Each slab is flattened and brushed under precision calibration to ensure even texture depth. Edges are square-cut and can be eased or chamfered upon request. Fabrication notes: install brushed surfaces following vein direction; seal lightly to preserve texture; avoid high-gloss sealants to maintain natural appearance.",

The honed finish then refines the surface to a satin-like matte, eliminating reflection while highlighting the travertine’s natural warmth. Together, they create a smooth, elegant surface suitable for minimal, balanced designs and contemporary interiors.",

          "text":" Blaundos Antico is specified for floors, wall cladding, countertops, fireplace surrounds, stair treads, and exterior façades. Its antique texture lends character to boutique hotels and residences, while honed or polished finishes suit refined interiors. Outdoors, brushed or tumbled slabs complement landscaping, garden paths, and pool decks. The stone’s tonal stability supports continuity between inside and outside, helping designers create cohesive transitions. With accurate sizing and reliable supply, it scales from small renovations to flagship builds.",
          "subtitle":"Interior & Exterior Use Cases",
          "subtext":"Indoors, Blaundos Antico brings warmth to living areas and statement value to feature walls or reception desks. In kitchens and baths, sealed surfaces provide practical durability with natural beauty. Externally, its weathered look enriches patios and façades, aging gracefully over time. For public spaces, coordinated formats (slabs, tiles, custom pieces) keep design language consistent. Majen’s technical support advises on finish selection, slip ratings, and maintenance to match climate, footfall, and performance requirements."

          "AvailableSection":{
          "title":"Available Sizes & Thickness",
          "text":" Majen supplies slabs commonly at 2 cm and 3 cm thickness, cut from blocks selected for tone and structure. Custom dimensions can be produced on request, including book-matched sets for feature walls. Tight calibration and precision polishing ensure flatness and clean edges that speed installation. For special elements—vanities, stair treads, or oversized cladding—our team provides cut-to-size options that maintain vein continuity. Consistent sizing across batches supports predictable waste rates and accurate take-offs.",
          "subtitle":"Dimensional Tolerances",
          "subtext":"Slab thickness is controlled within industry tolerances to support even load distribution and dependable adhesion. Surface regularity reduces lippage risk on large floors, while square edges and stable geometry help installers achieve fine joints in visual-critical areas. For ventilated façades and lightweight assemblies, we coordinate with fabricators to meet bracket and anchor constraints. All dimensions are verified at dispatch, and reports are available for documentation and submittal packages when required."

Finishes are applied with calibrated equipment to keep tone and sheen consistent across lots. For export, slabs are packed in reinforced wooden bundles with corner guards, interleaves, and strapping that limits movement in transit. Moisture-resistant wrapping and clear labeling aid handling at ports and job sites. Packaging is optimized for container loading to minimize risk and freight costs.",
          "subtitle":"Surface Finish Guidance",
          "subtext":"Select polished for premium interiors, honed for low-glare sophistication, brushed where texture is desired, and tumbled for rustic, outdoor-ready charm. In wet areas or exterior paths, combine texture with appropriate sealers to improve maintenance and slip performance. We can supply matched samples across finishes so teams preview appearance under project lighting. This process helps align expectations early, reducing change orders and helping stakeholders approve materials quickly and confidently.",
           "subtitle2":"Export Packaging Standards",
          "subtext2":"Each bundle is photographed and measured prior to loading. Straps, braces, and internal blocking limit vibration, while protective interlayers reduce abrasion. Bundle IDs map to packing lists for fast checks at customs and on site. Shock indicators can be added on request. The goal is simple: slabs arrive installation-ready, with documentation that keeps receiving and quality verification efficient for importers and contractors."

        {
          "q": "Which finishes are best for bathrooms?",
          "a": "Honed and tumbled finishes are the most recommended for bathrooms, as they offer slip comfort and a natural feel. Polished finishes may look luxurious but can be slippery when wet, so they are best reserved for vanity tops or decorative walls."

        {
          "q": "Do travertine tiles need sealing?",
          "a": "Yes. Like most natural stones, travertine tiles are porous and require sealing to prevent stains and moisture absorption.

          "q": "Can travertine tiles be used outdoors?",
          "a": "Absolutely. Travertine tiles, especially in tumbled and brushed finishes, are excellent for outdoor use. They are commonly installed in patios, garden paths, and pool decks due to their slip resistance and weather durability. Proper installation and sealing will maximize performance outdoors."

      "extra": [
        { "q": "What tile thickness do I need?", "a": "Indoors, 10–12 mm works for most floors and walls. Outdoors or high-load areas may require 30 mm pavers. We’ll advise based on drawings." },
        { "q": "Are travertine tiles suitable for pool areas?", "a": "Yes—tumbled or brushed finishes improve grip for wet zones. Combine with proper drainage and periodic sealing." },
