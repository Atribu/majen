The stone’s bright color improves light reflection indoors and creates a warm, welcoming aesthetic outdoors. With Majen’s direct quarry access and strict quality selection, every block is delivered with consistent tone, reliable strength, and export‑ready documentation.",

              "intro":     "Ivory Filled Natural Vein Cut Travertine Slabs present the stone in its most honest character: creamy beige tones, linear veining, and a subtly raw surface that feels grounded and calm. The filled structure closes natural pores for easier maintenance and long‑term durability, while the natural face preserves the authentic touch of travertine without additional gloss or brushing. Selected from premium Turkish quarries and processed with precise calibration, Majen delivers tone‑consistent slabs prepared for global export and high‑end architectural installations.",
              "intro2":     "This specification suits designers seeking minimal, nature‑forward interiors and relaxed outdoor environments. Indoors, the natural face offers low glare and tactile honesty for living rooms, feature walls, corridors, and spa zones. In covered exteriors, the vein‑cut orientation provides directional flow across façades and colonnades, enhancing rhythm in large surfaces. The light ivory palette pairs beautifully with wood, limestone accents, and neutral textiles, creating serene, biophilic spaces in both residential and hospitality contexts.",

              "title2":"What Is Filled Brushed Vein Cut Travertine?",
              "intro2":"“Vein Cut” reveals the linear direction of the stone’s natural formation. When filled, the stone’s pores are sealed for strength and smoother maintenance; “Brushed” finishing then enhances surface texture with a gentle matte relief. This combination preserves the beauty of travertine veins while improving traction and tactile appeal. Majen’s controlled brushing process creates consistent texture across large areas, ideal for seamless architectural integration.",

               "TextSection": {
            "header1": "Advantages of the Brushed Finish on Vein Cut Slabs",
            "text1": "Brushing enhances the natural feel of travertine, creating a lightly textured surface that is slip-resistant yet smooth to the touch. Unlike polished finishes, it diffuses light softly, emphasizing the stone’s natural flow without glare. Filled pores maintain structural integrity and easy cleaning, making this finish ideal for both interior and exterior use. Majen’s advanced brushing lines ensure depth consistency and premium surface uniformity on every slab.",
            "header2": "Recommended Applications & Design Pairings",
            "text2": "Use Filled Brushed Vein Cut Travertine Slabs for wall cladding, spa areas, pool decks, terraces, and interior feature walls. The balanced matte texture gives spaces a calm, organic character that complements wood, metal, and glass materials. Pair with polished or honed finishes for visual contrast or with matching tiles for seamless indoor–outdoor transitions. Majen supplies cut-to-size elements to ensure design and pattern continuity across all surfaces.",

Each slab is flattened and brushed under precision calibration to ensure even texture depth. Edges are square-cut and can be eased or chamfered upon request. Fabrication notes: install brushed surfaces following vein direction; seal lightly to preserve texture; avoid high-gloss sealants to maintain natural appearance.",

      "items": [
        {
          "q": "Are travertine tiles good for flooring?",
          "a": "Yes. Travertine tiles are widely used for flooring because they combine strength, beauty, and durability. They handle daily foot traffic well and maintain a timeless aesthetic. When sealed and cared for properly, they can last for decades in both residential and commercial environments."
        },
        {
          "q": "Which finishes are best for bathrooms?",
          "a": "Honed and tumbled finishes are the most recommended for bathrooms, as they offer slip comfort and a natural feel. Polished finishes may look luxurious but can be slippery when wet, so they are best reserved for vanity tops or decorative walls."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do travertine tiles need sealing?",
          "a": "Yes. Like most natural stones, travertine tiles are porous and require sealing to prevent stains and moisture absorption. It is essential to seal upon installation and reapply every 12–24 months, depending on traffic and exposure. This simple maintenance step significantly extends their lifespan."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can travertine tiles be used outdoors?",
          "a": "Absolutely. Travertine tiles, especially in tumbled and brushed finishes, are excellent for outdoor use. They are commonly installed in patios, garden paths, and pool decks due to their slip resistance and weather durability. Proper installation and sealing will maximize performance outdoors."
        }
      ],

     
      "extra": [
        { "q": "What tile thickness do I need?", "a": "Indoors, 10–12 mm works for most floors and walls. Outdoors or high-load areas may require 30 mm pavers. We’ll advise based on drawings." },
        { "q": "Are travertine tiles suitable for pool areas?", "a": "Yes—tumbled or brushed finishes improve grip for wet zones. Combine with proper drainage and periodic sealing." },
        { "q": "How is pricing determined?", "a": "Color grade, finish, size, thickness and order volume affect price. Share a BOQ and destination port for an accurate FOB/CIF quote." },
        { "q": "How often should I reseal?", "a": "Typically every 12–24 months depending on exposure and traffic. Kitchens and outdoors may need more frequent care." }
